= To Do

We want to put out a 0.25 release with the new Features API.

- Merge Sound's new API from coerce to master
- Figure out the default/builder relationship
  - Should default take string args like Moose and Mouse?

= Features

This is a list of all the known things we might do. The list will help us make
better design decisions of core Mo.

Please keep in mind that it is not a design goal that all of these play nicely
with each other. We want that to happen more and more, but it shouldn't be a
showstopper if "X does not work if declared after Y and without Z". We just
add that to the doc and carry on.

Please feel free to add to this list.
