NAME
    Mo - Micro Objects

SYNOPSIS
        package Reaper;
        use Mo 'Cow Bell';
        extends 'SNL';

        has 'will' => (is => 'ro');

DESCRIPTION
    Mo is gives you a "new" constructor, "has" accessors and "extends" in
    one file called Mo.pm. That's all.

    Moose led to Mouse led to Moo led to Mo. I'm sure when Mo is too much
    Moose, someone will make M.
